## Meal Planning 

To get started, clone the repository and from the project directory run 

```bash 
$ make docker-build 
```

to build the docker image. Then use 

```bash 
$ make docker-run 
```

to start the container runtime.

**Important**: Make sure to populate `.env` with your Edamam credentials.
